# MAST30034FinalProject #
Final project (Team 25) for MAST30034 Applied Data Science, Semester2 2020, University of Melbourne. \
This project explores liquor sales in Iowa. Models are built to predict total liquor volume. \
## final_version folder ###
This folder contains all the used datasets, codes and the produced figures. 
* ### Codes folder ###
  Codes are divided into three main parts: Pre-processing-> Model development -> Application
  #### 1. Part1 Pre-processing 
    Data cleansing, attribute analysis and feature engineering \
    The dataset "data_200k_latest.csv" contains the extracted 200,000 sale records for the model development part. 
  #### 2. Part2 Model Development 
    Model development, parameter tuning, and performance comparisons
  #### 3. Part3 Application 
    Predict the liquor sales for the 2019 and 2020 dataset using the optimal model. \
    The dataset "2019_population.csv" contains the population information by county in Iowa in 2019. \
    The dataset "2020_population.csv" contains the population information by county in Iowa in 2020. \
    The dataset "data_2019_100k.csv" contains extracted 100,000 sale records in 2019 for prediction  \
    The dataset "data_2020_100k.csv" contains extracted 100,000 sale records in 2020 for prediction.
