# MAST30034FinalProject
Final project (Team 25) for MAST30034 Applied Data Science, Semester2 2020, University of Melbourne. \
This project explores liquor sales in Iowa. Models are built to predict total liquor volume. 
The liquor sales dataset could be downloaded https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy (2012-2020)
The merged population dataset is downloaded from  https://data.iowa.gov/Community-Demographics/County-Population-in-Iowa-by-Year/qtnr-zsrc (1990 - 2018)
### Codes folder:    
#### Part1 Pre-processing

  The dataset "data_200k_latest.csv" contains the extracted 200,000 sale records for the model development part. 
#### Part2 Model Development
  Model development, parameter tuning, and performance comparisons
#### Part3 Application 
  Predict the liquor sales for the 2019 and 2020 dataset using the optimal model. \
  The dataset "2019_population.csv" contains the population information by county in Iowa in 2019. The dataset is from https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/counties-estimates \
  The dataset "2020_population.csv" contains the population information by county in Iowa in 2020. This dataset is from https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-counties/states/ia \
  The dataset "data_2019_100k.csv" contains extracted 100,000 sale records in 2019 for prediction  \
  The dataset "data_2020_100k.csv" contains extracted 100,000 sale records in 2020 for prediction.
