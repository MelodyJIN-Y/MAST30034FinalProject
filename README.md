# MAST30034FinalProject
Final project (group) for MAST30034 Applied Data Science. 2020 Semester2 
This project explores the liquor sales in Iowa. Models are built to predict total liquor volume. 
The liquor sales dataset could be downloaded https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy (2012-2020)
The merged population datasets are downloaded from   https://data.iowa.gov/Community-Demographics/County-Population-in-Iowa-by-Year/qtnr-zsrc (1990 - 2018)
                                                     
### Analysis Steps:
#### Part1 Pre-processing
  Data cleanring, attribute analysis and feature engineering
  The dataset "data_200k_latest.csv" contains the extracted 200,000 sale records for the model development part 
#### Part2 Model Development
  Model development, parameter tuning and perfromance comparisons
#### Part3 Application 
  Predict the liquor sales for 2019 and 2020 dataset using the optimal model. 
  The dataset "2019_population.csv" contains the population information by county in Iowa in 2019. The dataset is from https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/counties-estimates
  The dataset "2019_population.csv" contains the population information by county in Iowa in 2020. This dataset is from https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-counties/states/ia 
  The dataset "data_2019_100k.csv" contains extracted 100,000 sale records in 2019 for prediction  
  The dataset "data_2020_100k.csv" contains extracted 100,000 sale records in 2020 for prediction
